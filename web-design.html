	<h3>Introduction - The ultimate goal of web design</h3>
	<p>You need a beautiful website, but much more. The ultimate goal is to:</p>
	<div class="d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row ">
		<ol class="font-weight-bold">
		    <li>Bring more visitors to your site.</li>
		    <li>Build a trustful relationship with your visitors.</li>
		    <li>Convert the visitors into your new customers.</li>
		</ol>
		<div class="">
			<img src="{{"/assets/images/web-design-goals.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - the ultimate goals of web design" class="h_6 pb-4 pl-5">
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>The interaction with your customers starts from their first ‘click’ to your site. Good user experience is the key to build the trust between you and your customers.</p>
	<p>When we are designing your website, we always focus on the natural conversation with your visitors. People come because they want to get something done. That’s why we always design from inside out. Our design is to provide visitors the information they are looking for in an easy, straightforward, efficient and professional way. </p>
	<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Below are our <strong> 3 </strong> key steps for a successful web design.</p>

<div class="">

</div>

<section id="goal" class="pt_space">
	<h3>1. Set Up Your Goals</h3>
	<p>Setting up the goal is the most important part of web design. Without a thoughtful consideration of the goal, the whole site will be set off in a wrong direction. Here are the questions that need to be addressed before starting your web design:</p>
	<ul class="font-weight-bold">
		<li>Who are this site for?</li>
		<li>What do they expect to find or achieve from your site?</li>
		<li>What could you offer or how could you help?</li>
		<li>How are your competitors doing on their sites? What make you different from your competitors?</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="mb-0 pb-0">A successful web design always focuses on users’ problems and concerns. The more time trying to figure out how actually you could help your users and provide what they need out of the website, the better result you will get.</p>

<section id="content" class="pt_space">
	<h3>2. Create Quality Contents</h3>
	<img src="{{"/assets/images/core-page.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - content first web design" class="p-2 h_10 float-right">
	<p class="mb-0 pb-0">Once you set up the clear goals, it will be easy for you to decide the core pages. The core pages of your website are usually the most visited pages. The core pages are a clear match of users needs and your business goals. </p>
	<div id="content1" class="pt_space">
		<h4 class="text-success">Have the nature conversation with your customers</h4>
		<p class="mb-0 pb-0">When writing the content, simple think that you are having a conversation with your users. Try to avoid meaningless words (which naturally flow in…)  and always focus on their top questions.</p>
	</div>

	<div  id="content2" class="pt_space">
		<h4 class="text-success">Content is more than text</h4>
		<img src="{{"/assets/images/web-content-forms.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - content first web design" class="p-2 h_8 float-left">
		<p>Bear in mind that content isn’t just words or texts, it could be in the form audio, video, graphics, and so on.</p>
	    <p class="mb-0 pb-0">We especially like photos from your business. Humans are visual by nature and simply process visual data better.  A good photo tells customers your business story in a seconds. Thus, make sure to collect all the best photos you took for your business before our meet-up. We will spend time with you to hand-pick the best ones for your site.</p>
	</div>

    <div  id="content3" class="pt_space">
	    <h4 class="text-success">We love listening to your story</h4>
	    <div class="bg-light  text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/story-book.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - create quality content for web design" class="pl-2 h_8 float-right">
  		</div>
	    <p class="mb-0 pb-0">A good website starts a real conversation with your customer and builds the trustful relationship. Customers like to hear your story, which makes them feel like interacting with real people. Sharing your business story, customer reviews and testimonials are all very powerful resources for building the connection. We love listening to your story and let’s make it live on your website.</p>

	<h3>3. Design to Best Deliver Contents</h3>
	<img src="{{"/assets/images/color-wheel.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - content first web design" class="p-2 h_10 float-right">
    <p>Best web design is meat to best support content. While content is the core of conversation, the design serves the purpose as delivering a better communication. </p>
    <p>For example, a website usually has its own branding colors. Coles is red, Woolworths is green and how about yours? When choosing the right colors for your site, we will think about your business presence first. What are the major colors from your business, or what are the colors best match your business photos? </p>
    <p class="mb-0 pb-0">There are a lot of more details for web design to consider, such as the layouts, the typography for titles, headlines or bodies, the different displays for different screens sizes, the use of icons, and so on. We will cover every detail for you to create the custom design that best supports your content.</p>

	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>In short, design doesn’t just function to make things pretty. It’s important for the design to optimise the <strong>readability and accessibility</strong> of the content, so that a viewer can quickly understand how you can help them. It’s your <strong>content</strong> that gets more visitors to your site, it is your <strong>content</strong> that will engage your visitors and turn them into customers and clients, and it is your <strong>content</strong> that is going to get you better search engine ranking.</p>
