  <h2>How to choose the right web developer for your site</h2>
  <p>When hiring a specialist to build the website, people usually focus on the design. However, choosing the right web developer for your site is as important as the front-end design. Developing the website to a high standard is the foundation to best user experience, higher search engine ranking, easy maintenance and much more.</p>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Below are the <strong>4</strong> important factors to consider when choosing your web developer.</p>
</section>

<section id="security" class="pt_space">
  <h3 class="text-success">Provide clean codes – Security is important</h3>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Web development should adhere to high standard. Especially, when it comes to on-site security, it is uncompromisable. Every development should put security on the top priority. If third-party libraries or packages are used, constant security check and upgrade should be include to protect user data.</p>
</section>

<section id="details" class="pt_space">
  <h3 class="text-success">Attention to details</h3>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Professional presence is highly important to your site. Sometime even a tiny bug will harm your image online. Good developers always make sure every detail is covered, checked, double-checked, well tested before publishing your site. </p>
</section>

<section id="vc" class="pt_space">
  <h3 class="text-success">Use Version Controls and System Back-up</h3>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">It’s inevitable that your site is constantly changing. Implementing version control allows you revert back to the previous version easily when anything goes wrong. It will also enable your site to be backed up remotely on different servers to avoid single point of failure.</p>
</section>

<section id="keepup" class="pt_space">
  <h3 class="text-success">Keep up-to-date with the technology</h3>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">The technology of web development is constantly evolving. A website designed with cutting edge technology a couple years ago may look ineffective, non-functional or out-dated now. For this reason, it is important to choose a web developer that always stay up-to-date on web development technology. They should be knowledgeable with current standards, best practice and trends to provide you ongoing professional support.</p>
