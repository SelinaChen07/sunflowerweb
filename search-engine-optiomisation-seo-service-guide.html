<section id="what" class="pt_space">
  <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
  <p>The online market is huge, but extremely competitive at the same time. When you are building a website for your business, the first thing to consider is how you can get more visitors to your site and convert them into customers. You want your website to be found and seen. That’s when search engine optimization (SEO) comes in. </p>
  <p  class="mb-0">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the online visibility of a website in a web search engine's <strong>unpaid</strong> results (also called <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>organic</strong> results). In general, the higher ranked on the search results page, the more visitors it will receive. These visitors could possibly be converted into customers.</p>
</section>

<section id="why" class="pt_space">
  <h2>Why SEO?</h2>
  <div class="bg-light  text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/why-seo.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - Why SEO" class="pr-2 h_8  float-left">
  </div>
  <p>Most people only click on the first page of their search results. According to the latest statistics, the first page of search results gains roughly around 75% traffic share.</p>
  <p  class="mb-0">A website without SEO is very likely to be invisible to users from search engine, which simply means you are missing out incredible amount of opportunities to drive traffic to your site. </p>
</section>

<section id="when" class="pt_space">
  <h2>When to start SEO?</h2>
  <h4>- The earlier, the better.</h4>
  <p  class="mb-0">Could I start SEO after finishing my new site? The answer is <strong>better not</strong>. Because there are so many aspects of SEO. It will not only impact the titles of your website pages or the entire structure, but also UX(User Experience) design, content writing and much more. If possible, try to consider SEO when you are thinking to build your new website or upgrade your old one. Otherwise, it will  cost you more time, efforts and money if you start SEO after the design and development of your website is completely finished.</p>
  <p>What if your website is already done and you are not happy with its search engine performance? The answer is you should start the SEO <strong>now</strong>. Still, the sooner the better.</p>
</section>

<section id="is" class="pt_space">
  <h2>Is SEO a one-time service?</h2>
  <p>These are some of the most common questions that our clients may ask.
  <ul class="list-unstyled font-italic">
    <li>“Could I just have one-time SEO service?” </li>
    <li>“Could you guarantee first-page ranking?” </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>These questions all sound very logical, but we are sorry that this is not the correct way to do SEO.</p>
  <p  class="mb-0">Yes, we can provide one-time SEO service and improve the ranking in a short period of time. But the same as the build up of your business in the real world, it takes time for your business to get to the top positions of search engine ranking. SEO should be an on-going activity as an essential part of your business management in order to achieve the long-term success. Sorry that that’s no shortcut or secrets to automatically rank your site first from search engine, but by following our best practices outlined below you will eventually outperform your competitors and stay at the top.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Google and other search engines constantly change their algorithms, but some core factors always remain the same. These core factors are what we value. Creating high quality websites with great contents, providing users with best user experience are always the key components of our SEO best practices, which will help your business build up the reputation and long-term success online.</p>

    <h4 class="text-success">Help search engine find and understand your content.</h4>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">How do you get your site on search engines?</h5>
    <p>Usually, including your site into search engine search results is free and easy. You don’t even need to do anything. The search engines will automatically find you. However, sometimes some common mistakes will prevent your site from being found. You could simply input “site:yourdomainname.com.au”in the google search box to see if every page of your site appears in the search results. If not, a further audit is needed to address the issue. Below are some of the common reasons:</p>
    <ul class="mb-0">
      <li>Your site is newly launched and search engine hasn't had time to crawl it yet.</li>
      <li>Search engine found an error when trying to crawl your site.</li>
      <li>Your website policy blocks search engine from crawling the site.</li>
      <li>The design of the site makes it difficult for search engine to crawl your content effectively.</li>
      <li>The site isn't well connected from other sites on the web.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Help search engine understand you.</h5>
    <p>Some of our clients may ask: “I am not a technical person and I totally have no idea of Google’s secret algorithms. How can I make my content easy for Google to understand?” </p>
    <p>The answer is easy and straightforward. Keep in mind that Google or other search engines are continuously working on their algorithms to improve user experience and they’ve been doing so well. If your site could be easily understood by normal users, it will be understood by Google.</p>
    <P>Below are our best practices to help search engine understand you:</P>
    <ul class="mb-0 pb-0">
      <li>Use unique, brief and accurate <strong>titles</strong> of each page.</br>
      Please be mindful that using the same title for every page is a common mistake that should be avoided.
        <div class="bg-light">
         <img src="{{"/assets/images/title1.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - use unique title for each page for SEO" class="my-4  px-lg-4 px-0 h_5">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Use the <strong>“description” meta tag</strong> to provide unique, accurate summary of each page.

          <img src="{{"/assets/images/meta.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - use unique title for each page  for SEO" class="my-4  px-lg-4 px-0 h_8">
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Use <strong>heading tags</strong> to emphasise the important text and provide better hierarchical structure for your contents.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>structured data</strong> markup to better display your content in the search results.
      Here are some of the content you could highlight with the  structured data markup:
        <ul>
          <li>Products you're selling</li>
          <li>Business location</li>
          <li>Videos about your products or business</li>
          <li>Opening hours</li>
          <li>Events listings</li>

      <li>Use human <strong> readable URLs</strong> which are easy to understand and remember by users.</li>
