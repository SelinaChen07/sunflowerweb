  <h2>Understand the truth of SEO</h2>
  <div class="bg-light text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/seo.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - What's SEO" class="pl-2 h_8  float-right">
  </div>
  <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the online visibility of a website in a web search engine's <strong>unpaid</strong> results (also called <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>organic</strong> results). In general, the higher ranked on the search results page, the more visitors the website will receive. Some of the visitors could then be converted into customers.</p>
  <p  class="mb-0">SEO has been a hot topic in the past decade as it brings the advantages of driving large amount of traffic online and dramatically increasing sales. Every business might want to rank better on search engine. However, there have been a lot of updates on SEO as Google constantly changes their algorithm every year. <strong>It’s important for business owners or webmasters to understand SEO correctly before they start any investment on SEO services.</strong></p>
</section>

<section id="understand1" class="pt_space">
    <h4 class="text-success">How does search engine actually work?</h4>    
    <p>It all starts with words typed into the small search box.</p>
    <div class="bg-light text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/higher-ranking.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - Understand SEO" class="pl-2 pb-2 h_10 float-right">
    </div>
    <p>When a user perform an online search, the search engine looks for the answers from its gigantic database (which is based on all the web pages contents from internet) and returns the results basing on two things:</p>    
    <ol>
      <li>1. The <strong>relevance</strong> to user’s query.</li>
      <li>2. The <strong>authority</strong> or <strong>credibility</strong> of the content provided by the page.</li>
    </ol>
    <p  class="pb-0">The relevance or authority is not decided by search engine manually. In fact, search engines have employed smart algorithms to calculate the relevance and authority of the contents in order to provide users with the most valuable results to their queries.</p>
</section>

<section id="understand2" class="pt_space">
    <h4 class="text-success">The past, present and future of SEO – Look at SEO correctly</h4>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">The past</h5>
    <div class="bg-light text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/stop.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - Understand SEO" class="pr-2 pb-2 h_3 float-left">
    </div>
    <p>When Google founded, they had relatively simple algorithm to calculate the relevance and authority of the search results. IT professionals figured out the rules and applied them in order to push the websites to higher positions. People shared this rules as everyone wanted to get to the first page which means more traffic, more leads and more customers. </p>
    <p>In those days, SEO is more about technical practices, which looked easy and predictable for SEO experts. People who invested on SEO could get the wanted result quickly.</p>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">The present</h5>
    <div class="bg-light text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/go.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - Understand SEO" class="pr-2 pb-2 h_5 float-left">
    </div>
    <p>However, Google won’t be such a successful company if it had not improved the algorithm. Search engine companies like Google constantly update their algorithm to prevent SEO experts from manipulating the search results. There were a lot of updates. Google’s algorithms comprise <strong>hundreds of variables</strong> nowadays, which are also called <strong>search engine ranking factors</strong>. </p>
    <p>Some of the most popular ranking factors used to contribute more to SEO had gradually phrased out as Google no longer uses them for the calculation. SEO today is more about quality contents. Google judges the quality and relevance of the content by calculating hundreds of factors and is getting smarter and smarter everyday. All the ranking factors are guaranteed confidential.</p>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">The future</h5>
    <div class="bg-light text-center">
          <img src="{{"/assets/images/no-magic.png" | relative_url }}" alt="Sunflower Web - Understand SEO" class="pr-2 pb-2 h_5 float-left">
    </div>
    <p  class="mb-0 pb-0">Looking forward, there’s no doubt that Google will be only getting smarter. <strong>Therefore, there won’t any shortcut or magical tricks to automatically rank your site first from search engine. Sorry!</strong> The search engine ranking result will only be more likely to reflect how your business positions in the real world. A successful business who out-beat its competitors in the real world is more likely to receive higher ranking online accordingly. Users will continue to trust Google as all the search results provided by Google are continuously useful and valuable. </p>

    <h4 class="text-success">Help search engine find and understand your content.</h4>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">How do you get your site on search engines?</h5>
    <p>Usually, including your site into search engine search results is free and easy. You don’t even need to do anything. The search engines will automatically find you. However, sometimes some common mistakes will prevent your site from being found. You could simply input “site:yourdomainname.com.au”in the google search box to see if every page of your site appears in the search results. If not, a further audit is needed to address the issue. Below are some of the common reasons:</p>
    <ul class="mb-0">
      <li>Your site is newly launched and search engine hasn't had time to crawl it yet.</li>
      <li>Search engine found an error when trying to crawl your site.</li>
      <li>Your website policy blocks search engine from crawling the site.</li>
      <li>The design of the site makes it difficult for search engine to crawl your content effectively.</li>
      <li>The site isn't well connected from other sites on the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="bg-light">

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Help search engine understand you.</h5>
    <p>Some of our clients may ask: “I am not a technical person and I totally have no idea of Google’s secret algorithms. How can I make my content easy for Google to understand?” </p>
    <p>The answer is easy and straightforward. Keep in mind that Google or other search engines are continuously working on their algorithms to improve user experience and they’ve been doing so well. If your site could be easily understood by normal users, it will be understood by Google.</p>
    <P>Below are our best practices to help search engine understand you:</P>
    <ul class="mb-0 pb-0">
      <li>Use unique, brief and accurate <strong>titles</strong> of each page.</br>
      Please be mindful that using the same title for every page is a common mistake that should be avoided.
