<section id="what" class="pt_space">
  <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
  <p>The online market is huge, but extremely competitive at the same time. When you are building a website for your business, the first thing to consider is how you can get more visitors to your site and convert them into customers. You want your website to be found and seen. That’s when search engine optimization (SEO) comes in. </p>
  <p  class="mb-0">Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of increasing the online visibility of a website in a web search engine's <strong>unpaid</strong> results (also called <strong>natural</strong> or <strong>organic</strong> results). In general, the higher ranked on the search results page, the more visitors it will receive. These visitors could possibly be converted into customers.</p>
</section>

<section id="why" class="pt_space">
  <h2>Why SEO?</h2>
  <p>Most people only click on the first page of their search results. According to the latest statistics, the first page of search results gains roughly around 75% traffic share.</p>
  <p  class="mb-0">A website without SEO is very likely to be invisible to users from search engine, which simply means you are missing out incredible amount of opportunities to drive traffic to your site. </p>
</section>

<section id="when" class="pt_space">
  <h2>When to start SEO?</h2>
  <h4>- The earlier, the better.</h4>
  <p  class="mb-0">Could I start SEO after finishing my new site? The answer is <strong>better not</strong>. Because there are so many aspects of SEO. It will not only impact the titles of your website pages or the entire structure, but also UX(User Experience) design, content writing and much more. If possible, try to consider SEO when you are thinking to build your new website or upgrade your old one. Otherwise, it will  cost you more time, efforts and money if you start SEO after the design and development of your website is completely finished.</p>
  <p>What if your website is already done and you are not happy with its search engine performance? The answer is you should start the SEO <strong>now</strong>. Still, the sooner the better.</p>
</section>

<section id="is" class="pt_space">
  <h2>Is SEO a one-time service?</h2>
  <p>These are some of the most common questions that our clients may ask.
  <ul class="list-unstyled font-italic">
    <li>“Could I just have one-time SEO service?” </li>
    <li>“Could you guarantee first-page ranking?” </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>These questions all sound very logical, but we are sorry that this is not the correct way to do SEO.</p>
  <p  class="mb-0">Yes, we can provide one-time SEO service and improve the ranking in a short period of time. But the same as the build up of your business in the real world, it takes time for your business to get to the top positions of search engine ranking. SEO should be an on-going activity as an essential part of your business management in order to achieve the long-term success. Sorry that that’s no shortcut or secrets to automatically rank your site first from search engine, but by following our best practices outlined below you will eventually outperform your competitors and stay at the top.</p>

  <h2>Our SEO Best Practices</h2>
  <h3> - Anything Worthwhile Takes Time</h3>
  <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Google and other search engines constantly change their algorithms, but some core factors always remain the same. These core factors are what we value. Creating high quality websites with great contents, providing users with best user experience are always the key components of our SEO best practices, which will help your business build up the reputation and long-term success online.</p>

  <section id="how1" class="pt_space">
    <h4 class="text-success">Help search engine find and understand your content.</h4>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">How do you get your site on search engines?</h5>
    <p>Usually, including your site into search engine search results is free and easy. You don’t even need to do anything. The search engines will automatically find you. However, sometimes some common mistakes will prevent your site from being found. You could simply input “site:yourdomainname.com.au”in the google search box to see if every page of your site appears in the search results. If not, a further audit is needed to address the issue. Below are some of the common reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your site is newly launched and search engine hasn't had time to crawl it yet.</li>
      <li>Search engine found an error when trying to crawl your site.</li>
      <li>Your website policy blocks search engine from crawling the site.</li>
      <li>The design of the site makes it difficult for search engine to crawl your content effectively.</li>
      <li>The site isn't well connected from other sites on the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Google has provided <a hreflang="en" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" class="text-success">Search Console</a> tool for webmasters, which is very helpful for you to keep monitoring your site’s search engine performance. If Google finds any critical issues on your site, you will receive alerts.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Help search engine understand you.</h5>
    <p>Some of our clients may ask: “I am not a technical person and I totally have no idea of Google’s secret algorithms. How can I make my content easy for Google to understand?” </p>
    <p>The answer is easy and straightforward. Keep in mind that Google or other search engines are continuously working on their algorithms to improve user experience and they’ve been doing so well. If your site could be easily understood by normal users, it will be understood by Google.</p>
    <P>Below are our best practices to help search engine understand you:</P>
    <ul class="mb-0 pb-0">
      <li>Use unique, brief and accurate titles of each page.</br>
      Please be mindful that using the same title for every page is a common mistake that should be avoided.
      </li>
      <li>Use the “description” meta tag to provide unique, accurate summary of each page.</li>
      <li>Use heading tags to emphasise the important text and provide better hierarchical structure for your contents.</li>
      <li>Use structured data markup to better display your content in the search results.
      Here are some of the content you could highlight with the  structured data markup:
        <ul>
          <li>Products you're selling</li>
          <li>Business location</li>
          <li>Videos about your products or business</li>
          <li>Opening hours</li>
          <li>Events listings</li>
          <li>Recipes</li>
          <li>Your company logo, and many more!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use human readable URLs which are easy to understand and remember by users.</li>
      <li>Help search engines find your images by using standard image formats and adding “alt” attribute to your images. Use brief but descriptive file names and “alt” text for all images.</li>
      <li>Provide video and audio contents with  transcripts.</li>
      <li>Supplement Flash or Java plug-ins with text.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="mb-0 pb-0">
      <li>Make your site mobile-friendly with responsive web design.</li>
      <li>Ensure your site to have fast loading speed.</li>
      <li>Organise your site hierarchy in order to allow users and search engines to easily navigate through your site.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-success">Optimize your content – This is the key!</h4>
    <p>Creating quality contents is the most important component of SEO which will influence the ranking of your website more than any other factor we discuss here in the long term!</p>
    <p>Both users and search engines like good contents, which will help build up your online reputation. Here are some of the effective ways to build quality contents:</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Make valuable and informative contents for readers</h5>
    
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Understand what your readers want and give it to them – keyword research</h5>
    <p>Users input keywords into the search box to find a piece of your content. Different users may use different keywords for the same topic. Having a good mix of these keyword phrases when writing your contents will help users and search engines to find you.</p>
    <p><a hreflang="en" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" class="text-success">Google search console</a> provides the top search queries your site appears for, which is very helpful to optimise your site for keyword targeting.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Create unique content</h5>
    <p>When creating your contents, consider what unique or better service that no other sites offer. This will provide you great advantage on your online ranking. </p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Provide fresh content</h5>
    <p class="mb-0 pb-0">Users and search engines like fresh contents. Keeping the information on your site up-to-date and continuously maintaining your website content are good practices.</p>    
  </section>

  <section id="how4" class="pt_space">
    <h4 class="text-success">Promote your website</h4>
    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Building inbound links, be careful who you link to and who link you</h5>
    <p>You can confer some of your reputation to the sites you link to. Likewise, your inbound links will confer some of their reputation to you as well. Having inbound links from websites with high reputation will have positive impact on your ranking. But also be careful of the inbound links from spam websites which could harm your reputation. You could check a full list of links to your site from <a hreflang="en" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/home?hl=en" class="text-success">Google Search Console</a>.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Reach out to those in your site’s community</h5>
    <p>Thinking about the related sites in your industry. Reaching out to them and exchanging information properly could be beneficial to your site.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Get Active on Social Media</h5>
    <p>Social media is getting very powerful for online marketing. Sharing the information of your services or products on social media could easily get more people in the interested group to know you. But be mindful that doing this in an extreme way sometimes will harm your reputation. Make sure only share quality, interesting items appropriately.</p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Create Google My Business account to help your customers find you from google maps</h5>
    <p>If you are running a local business, creating a <a hreflang="en" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/business/" class="text-success">Google My Business</a> account can be an easy and effective way to help users find you from google map. From Google My Business, you can promote the services or products you offer, share the opening hours, update beautiful business photos, create posts or events, invite customer to provide reviews and many more! </p>

    <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Collect Positive Customer Reviews and comment on your reviews</h5>
    <p>Users like to read reviews to help them make decision. Inviting customers to provide you a Google review every time after you provide your services or products could be very beneficial for your online presence in the long term.</p>
